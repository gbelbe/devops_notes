# Kubernetes

K8s automates the distribution and provisioning of applications containers across a cluster in a more efficient way.


1. K8s cluster:
    Coordinates a high availability cluster of computers connected to work as a single unit.
    Allow to deploy containerized applications without tying them to individual machines.


    a K8s clusters =  2 types of resources:
    - A master node that coordinates the cluster: 3 process that run on a single node that can be replicated
    - Nodes = workers that run the applications

    Each node has a Kubelet, agent for managing the node and communicating with the master. 
    Nodes also have tools for handling containers operations. (docker).
    A prod cluster should have a minimum of 3 nodes.

    When you deploy an app on k8s, you tell the master to start the application containers (docker run ...)

    Minikube is a lightweight k8s implementation that starts a VM on your machine and deploys a simple cluster on only one node.

    A node is a worker machine (either virtual or physical). Each node is managed by the master. A node can have multiple pods. The master automatically handle scheduling pods across nodes in the cluster.


2. K8s Deployments:

    Once we have a K8s cluster ready, we can deploy a containered application on top of it, through a **Deployment configuration**
    The deployments instructs K8s how to create and update instances on your app. K8s master node schedule app instances on individual nodes.
    After app instances are created, a **k8 deployment controller ** monitor those instances. 
    Self-healing mechanism to address machine failure or maintenance.
 
    To create a deployment, we need a container image and a number of replicas, we can modify that by changing the deployment. (scale up / update)

3. k8s Pods:

    A pod is a group of one or more containers tied together for administration and networking.  A K8s deployment checks on the health of your pod and
    restarts the container if they fails. Deployments are the way to scale or manage the creation of pods.

    kubctl create deployment hello-node --image=docker.io/gbelbe/nodejsk8s:1

    note: si Ã§a ne marche pas, tester la commande docker pull nom_de_limage, pour savoir si tout se passe bien
            kubectl get xxx  (nodes / pods / deployments...)

    Pods inside a kubernetes cluster are under a private isolated network. By default they are visible from other pods and services
    within the same cluster. but not outside that network. When we use Kubectl we interact through an API endpoint with the master node.

    **kubectl proxy** can create a proxy that will forward communication into the cluster private network from our terminal.

A pod models an application specific "logical host" and can contain different application containers that are tightly coupled.
> ex: nodejs app in a container, and another container with the data used by the app.
